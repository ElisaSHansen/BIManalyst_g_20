## A2b: Identify Claim

**Q: Select which building(s) to focus on for your focus area**

A: We'll be focusing at building #2516

**Q: Identify a ‘claim’ / issue / fact to check from one of those reports.**

A: As stated on page 11 of the report, the capacity is deemed sufficient, with a utilization of 27%. Accordingly, our assessment will focus on verifying whether the axial capacity is adequate to resist the loads imposed by the beams and slabs.

**Q: Justify your selection of your claim**
A: By focusing on this aspect within the BIM model, we ensure that the interaction between structural elements is properly accounted for and that potential risks of underestimation of load transfer are minimized.
