**Q: Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:** 

A: At the beginning of this course, my experience with programming, the IFC standard, and the broader BIM universe was extremely limited. I had little understanding of what was possible, how BIM data could be structured, or how IFC could be used in practice.
Now, at the end of the course, I can confidently say that I’ve grown into a far more capable BIM analyst. I understand how to use various tools to extract, interpret, and work with BIM data, and I feel more comfortable navigating the OpenBIM ecosystem. That being said, I still have a long journey ahead before I could call myself an “OpenBIM Champion.” The possibilities within BIM are huge, and I’ve only taken my first steps, but they have been meaningful ones.

**Q: What else do you still need to learn?**

A: There is still a lot I want to explore, especially within larger and more complex projects. Our assignment focused specifically on columns in a building, which naturally limited the IFC libraries and concepts we needed to work with. Moving forward, I want to dive deeper into other IFC libraries and learn how to integrate them more effectively with OpenBIM tools. I’m particularly interested in understanding how larger datasets flow through different disciplines in full-scale projects.

**Q: How you might use OpenBIM in the future**

A: I see OpenBIM becoming an important part of my workflow, especially in group-based or interdisciplinary projects. OpenBIM provides a transparent, reliable, and structured approach to handling data, something that is essential when collaborating across teams. As the construction industry continues its digital transformation, OpenBIM offers a safe and effective way to store, exchange, and coordinate information.

## My process of developing the tutorial

**Q: Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?**

A: Yes. I feel that the course helped me understand how to frame questions, structure problems, and think critically about data workflows. It also pushed me to develop tools and approaches that I can build upon later, potentially even in my thesis work in other courses.

**Q: Would you have preferred to have been given less choise in the use cases?**

A: No. I appreciated the flexibility. Being able to choose a topic based on my own interests allowed me to explore what I was curious about from the start. The course encouraged independence rather than restricting us, and that freedom made the experience more meaningful and motivating.

**Q: Was the number of tools for the course ok – should we have more or less? If so which ones yould you leave out?**

A: Overall, I think the number of tools we used was just right.
I’ll be honest, I didn’t fully understand the purpose of the Miro board or how it connected to the rest of the workflow. But aside from that, we had access to more than enough tools to support our learning.
Since I had limited Python experience before this course, being “forced” to work with it was actually a great learning opportunity. Blender is the one tool I didn’t end up using much, but I would have loved to either learn more about it or explore how OpenBIM could integrate with tools like Revit.

## My future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

**Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your theisis?**

A: Yes, absolutely. I plan to use OpenBIM, and the tool I developed, in future courses and assignments. It provides a solid foundation for group collaboration in courses such as Structural Precast Concrete Buildings, Advanced Building Design, and any other teamwork subjects.

**Q: Are you likely to use OpenIBM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years.**

A: Yes. OpenBIM is becoming increasingly important in the industry and is growing rapidly in relevance. I’m grateful that I chose this course because it has given me practical exposure to tools and concepts I can use in real-world projects. I expect OpenBIM to be part of my work life, especially when working in teams that depend on efficient workflows and secure data exchange.

## Wrap up

**Q: Conclude the journey through A1-A5**

A: My journey from A1 to A5 has been genuinely meaningful. I started out knowing almost nothing about the larger BIM world, how to navigate it, what the possibilities were, or even how to approach programming within it. Now, at the end of the course, I’ve developed a tool that not only I can use, but one that others may benefit from as well.
Throughout this process, I’ve learned how to extract data from IFC files, how to structure and share information, how to work with BIM standards and different libraries, and how important it is to plan the workflow from start to finish, in order to work efficiently. I’ve also gained valuable experience in working collaboratively within teams.

## As a group - summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial:

**Q: Did the tool address the use case you identified?**

A: We had to make a few adjustments throughout the workflow. Our original plan was to develop a tool that could receive load data generated by another group’s script. However, this turned out not to be feasible, as they were unable to determine which specific columns the loads were distributed to.

Because of this, we decided instead to manually implement the loads at the beginning of our script, using the values provided in the report from Advanced Building Design, rather than integrating a Python script and building our tool around that input.

Aside from this change, we believe our tool still fully aligns with the use case we defined at the start of the project. Ensuring that our final solution matched our intended purpose was important to us, and we are satisfied that we achieved that.

**Q: Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:** 

A: I started as an analyst because this was a role my partner and I wanted to explore further. We had no previous experience with coding in Python, so we were motivated to dive deeper into how programming can be applied within BIM. We remained analysts throughout the entire course and stayed consistent in our direction, because early on we identified exactly what we wanted to achieve with our code.

**Q: What else do you still need to learn?**

A: I want to learn more about the practical use cases for this type of approach in the BIM world. The IfcOpenShell library was overwhelming at first, and I would like to understand more about its structure and the broader possibilities it offers beyond what we implemented in our project. By exploring the library further, I can gain valuable knowledge that will be relevant for my future career and academic work.

**Q: How you might use OpenBIM in the future**

A: Our intention has been to develop a tool that could be used later in our studies and careers. I look forward to the continued development of OpenBIM standards, especially regarding clearer definitions of information requirements at different BIM levels. This will make it easier to develop tools that work reliably across models.

Next semester I will take “Advanced Building Design”, and I expect to use the knowledge I gained to validate and check the model we create in that course. Our tool will allow me to quickly verify whether the necessary information exists in the model and whether it is correct.

## My process of developing the tutorial

**Q: Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?**

A: Yes. At the beginning of the course, we spent a lot of time formulating questions that could be answered using IfcOpenShell. When the time comes to develop a research question for my master's thesis, I will definitely keep in mind that I now have the knowledge and the tools to answer engineering questions in new ways. This course has changed how I think about structural engineering problems because I now have additional methods for exploring and validating information.

**Q: Would you have preferred to have been given less choise in the use cases?**

A: I will admit that it was overwhelming at first to define a use case, because there were so many possibilities. Our strategy was to choose one structural element and calculate something manageable. The advantage of having many options is that it gives the freedom to explore topics we genuinely care about. Therefore, in the end, I think it was beneficial to have this freedom. The manager–analyst structure also made it easier to define a clear problem, and our group wanted a project with a coherent direction.

**Q: Was the number of tools for the course ok – should we have more or less? If so which ones yould you leave out?**

A: I think the selection of tools in the course was good. I especially see the strong value in using GitHub. I don’t think additional tools are necessary because the provided tools are sufficient for the learning goals.

## My future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

**Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your theisis?**

A: Yes, the code we developed is highly relevant for use in my master’s thesis or other future projects. Our script calculates area, dimensions, axial capacity, and filters columns by storey, which makes it a very practical and efficient tool. However, it does depend on having an IFC model for the structure, so it remains to be seen whether that fits my thesis topic. Regardless, this process has opened an entire library of possibilities for other types of calculations and model checks using Python.

**Q: Are you likely to use OpenIBM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years.**

A: I recently had a job interview where we discussed the work I completed in this course. I received positive feedback because the company is currently developing spreadsheets and automated calculations based on IFC models. They viewed this type of knowledge as valuable.
In my professional life over the next decade, I expect to further develop my skills within OpenBIM so I can perform seamless checks on structural models and FEM outputs. This will benefit not only my own work but can also be shared with colleagues, making workflows more efficient across entire engineering teams.


## Wrap up

**Q: Conclude the journey through A1-A5**

My journey in this course has been both challenging and rewarding. I have gained practical skills in OpenBIM and learned how information extraction can be optimized using Python. The tool we developed has taught me how IFC data can be analyzed, validated, and used for structural capacity checks in an automated way. This knowledge is highly relevant for my future career and studies, and the script we created is something I, and others, can build on moving forward. The course has expanded my understanding of what is possible with OpenBIM, and it has given me tools that I will continue to use in both academic and professional contexts.
