** Q: Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended:** 

A: At the beginning of this course, my experience with programming, the IFC standard, and the broader BIM universe was extremely limited. I had little understanding of what was possible, how BIM data could be structured, or how IFC could be used in practice.
Now, at the end of the course, I can confidently say that I’ve grown into a far more capable BIM analyst. I understand how to use various tools to extract, interpret, and work with BIM data, and I feel more comfortable navigating the OpenBIM ecosystem. That being said, I still have a long journey ahead before I could call myself an “OpenBIM Champion.” The possibilities within BIM are huge, and I’ve only taken my first steps, but they have been meaningful ones.

** Q: What else do you still need to learn? **

A: There is still a lot I want to explore, especially within larger and more complex projects. Our assignment focused specifically on columns in a building, which naturally limited the IFC libraries and concepts we needed to work with. Moving forward, I want to dive deeper into other IFC libraries and learn how to integrate them more effectively with OpenBIM tools. I’m particularly interested in understanding how larger datasets flow through different disciplines in full-scale projects.

** Q: How you might use OpenBIM in the future **

A: I see OpenBIM becoming an important part of my workflow, especially in group-based or interdisciplinary projects. OpenBIM provides a transparent, reliable, and structured approach to handling data, something that is essential when collaborating across teams. As the construction industry continues its digital transformation, OpenBIM offers a safe and effective way to store, exchange, and coordinate information.

## My process of developing the tutorial

** Q: Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis? **

A: Yes. I feel that the course helped me understand how to frame questions, structure problems, and think critically about data workflows. It also pushed me to develop tools and approaches that I can build upon later, potentially even in my thesis work in other courses.

** Q: Would you have preferred to have been given less choise in the use cases? **

A: No. I appreciated the flexibility. Being able to choose a topic based on my own interests allowed me to explore what I was curious about from the start. The course encouraged independence rather than restricting us, and that freedom made the experience more meaningful and motivating.

** Q: Was the number of tools for the course ok – should we have more or less? – if so which ones yould you leave out? **

A: Overall, I think the number of tools we used was just right.
I’ll be honest, I didn’t fully understand the purpose of the Miro board or how it connected to the rest of the workflow. But aside from that, we had access to more than enough tools to support our learning.
Since I had limited Python experience before this course, being “forced” to work with it was actually a great learning opportunity. Blender is the one tool I didn’t end up using much, but I would have loved to either learn more about it or explore how OpenBIM could integrate with tools like Revit.

## My future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

** Q: Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your theisis? **

A: Yes, absolutely. I plan to use OpenBIM, and the tool I developed, in future courses and assignments. It provides a solid foundation for group collaboration in courses such as Structural Precast Concrete Buildings, Advanced Building Design, and any other teamwork subjects.

** Q: Are you likely to use OpenIBM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years. **

A: Yes. OpenBIM is becoming increasingly important in the industry and is growing rapidly in relevance. I’m grateful that I chose this course because it has given me practical exposure to tools and concepts I can use in real-world projects. I expect OpenBIM to be part of my work life, especially when working in teams that depend on efficient workflows and secure data exchange.

## Wrap up

** Q: Conclude the journey through A1-A5 **

A: My journey from A1 to A5 has been genuinely meaningful. I started out knowing almost nothing about the larger BIM world, how to navigate it, what the possibilities were, or even how to approach programming within it. Now, at the end of the course, I’ve developed a tool that not only I can use, but one that others may benefit from as well.
Throughout this process, I’ve learned how to extract data from IFC files, how to structure and share information, how to work with BIM standards and different libraries, and how important it is to plan the workflow from start to finish, in order to work efficiently. I’ve also gained valuable experience in working collaboratively within teams.
